# F18: Design & Engineering of Intelligent Information Systems

## Project 0

* Project 0 Module - https://theproject.zone/f18-11791/pi0

## Development References

* TPZ TA Manual - https://github.com/CloudComputingCourse/TA-Manual

### Submitter

1. In `submitter.sh` implement the `grade` function to include any code that should be run on the student's instance (or wherever the submitter is being run from)
   1. Any files written in the same directory as the submitter (or any child directory) will be included in the submission tar.gz file 

```bash
export TPZ_USERNAME=
export TPZ_PASSWORD=

./submitter.sh
```

### Grader

#### Important Files
* [Grader.java](grader/src/main/java/edu/cmu/scs/cs/_11791/Grader.java)
  * This is the main class of the resulting jar built by `mvn package`. When to run `mvn package`?
  * It will make use of the `JsonGradeStrategy` class provided by [grader-utils](https://github.com/CloudComputingCourse/grader-utils/wiki/Library-Usage) to evaluate the output generated by the submitter. When? What initiates this action?

* [reference.yaml](grader/src/main/resources/reference.yaml)
  * For the `JsonGradeStrategy` a reference answer will be provided to the grader.
  * In this example, we will read the `output.json` included in the student's submission. The [submitter.sh](submitter/submitter.sh) in this example project will create a submission that includes [output.json](submitter/output.json), which will result in a full score during grading.
  * [reference.yaml](grader/src/main/resources/reference.yaml) has three question (`q1` - `q3`) each worth 5 points. The id `q1` - `q3` corresponds to the column name in the [hello-world](https://theproject.zone/f18-11791/pi0/tasks/hello-world) TPZ task.

#### Build and Deploy
* Before building the package you will need to install the [grader-utils](https://github.com/CloudComputingCourse/grader-utils/wiki/Library-Usage) and [upload-grader-maven-plugin](https://github.com/CloudComputingCourse/CloudComputingUtils/wiki/Plugin-Usage) packages.
* How? What steps to follow to install such things, where do they end up?
* Before that happens, you will need to install Maven and Java.

```bash
$ cd grader

$ mvn clean package
```
